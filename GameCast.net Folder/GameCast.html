  <h1 style = "color:lightblue;">What purpose dose GameCast have?</h1>
  
 <p style = "color:lightblue;" >GameCast is a webpage about video games in the future you're going to be able to play games, upload your own, add friends, and more. 
who made GameCast and why? Well, it was me, Brandon Olinger, the CEO of GameCast I decided that making a website about uploading games and playing them  
was interesting, So I decided to make Game Cast where you can share your games to the world! Game Cast is currently under development and won't be done for a long time.
this is because there are still a lot of features I have to add like sharing, liking other games that people have posted,The users' section is under development,
The Quick Access is under development,and also login and register is under development this might take a long time because there is so much more still being worked on! so if you got any ideas the let me know and ill be sure to add them later.
to contact Game Cast, go to my email linked on this webpage and i'll respond within a couple of days.
